## Description 
No code solution to display ACF Fields using the ACF field block.
The ACF field block displays individual fields registered using ACF.

It supports the following field types:

* - Basic: Text, Text Area, Number, Range, Email, URL, Password
* - Content: Image, File, WYSIWYG Editor, oEmbed, Gallery
* - Choice: Select, Checkbox, Radio Button, Button Group, True / False
* - Relational: Link, Post Object, Page Link, Relationship, Taxonomy, User
* - Advanced: Google Map, Date Picker, Date Time Picker, Time Picker, Color Picker
* - Layout: Group, Clone, Repeater, Flexible Content

Features

- Uses a single block â€“ ACF field
- The block can be used within the Query Loop
- Most field types are rendered in the block editor.


This plugin depends on Advanced Custom Fields PRO; it uses the plugin's block logic.


For PHP developers
The extensible architecture allows:
- overrides to rendering logic by field type,
- rendering for custom field types,
- rendering for custom field names


If you want to alter the output from the `acf-field-block/acf-field` block
then you can either hook into the `render_block_acf-field-block/acf-field` filter to
modify the generated HTML,
or the `acf_field_block_get_renderer` filter to set your own callback function/method
for a field type or specific field.
